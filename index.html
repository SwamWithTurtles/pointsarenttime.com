                    Story points are an <strong>arbitrary unit</strong> of <strong>complexity, expected effort and doubt</strong>
                    <!-- div class="explanation">
                        This can be thought by analogy to time taken vs distance travelled. Estimating distance is
                        relatively straightforward, particularly in comparison to other distances. Time is an
                        combination of distance and speed, and requires that you estimate not only how much work
                        there is but how fast you can do it, at the same time. Using points & velocity lets us
                        separate these two concerns.
